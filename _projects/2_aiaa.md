My main research project at the moment is studying magnetohydrodynamic power generation for oxy-fuel based carbon capture.  You can find my most recent paper study the electrical resistance of our MHD channel here:
### [Resistance Measurements of a High-velocity Oxy-fuel Powered MHD Channel](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2020-3656)


# About MHD power generation

A MHD generator is an electric generator without moving parts. Because of the
lack of moving parts, MHD generators can run at high temperatures. The high
temperatures enables higher efficiency, but most importantly oxy-fuel based
carbon capture. However, the lack of moving parts also introduces formidable
engineering challenges. The goal of the MHD group is to reexamine the prospect
of overcoming these challenges with modern scientific insights and technology.

At NETL we study MHD power generation with a high-velociy  oxy-fuel combustion system

# Advanced diagnostics     


Paired with historical knowledge, we want to use new experimental technology to try and overcome these engieering challenges. 

For example, we have recently developed a real-time absorption-emission setup to generate time-series potassium number density.
