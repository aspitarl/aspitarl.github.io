<h1>Welcome to the MHD Lab interactive data website</h1>

The plots below show the time-series data from the video above. The plots are interactive. Use the drop down menus to select a signal.  Select the 'box+' icon on the right to activate the box select tool that can then be used to select a region in time. 
Note, this may take a minute to load.

<h1>MHD Generators </h1>


A MHD generator is an electric generator without moving parts. Because of the
lack of moving parts, MHD generators can run at high temperatures. The high
temperatures enables higher efficiency, but most importantly oxy-fuel based
carbon capture. However, the lack of moving parts also introduces formidable
engineering challenges. The goal of the MHD group is to reexamine the prospect
of overcoming these challenges with modern scientific insights and technology.

<h1>Learning from previous research with natrual language processing </h1>

MHD power generation technology was studied extensively from the period of
rougly 1960-1990, before funding was cut. During this era, a yearly MHD
conference took place where researchers submitted papers outlinging their work
into conference proceedings, called the symposium on the engineering aspects of
magnetohydrodynamics (SEAMS). Our group has recemtly digitized this collection
of literature and developed natural language processing tools to find insights
of how to overcome these engineering challenges. 
<br>

Below you see a 2D representation of the SEAMS collection. Each dot represents a
paper. The papers are clustered together according to their similarity with two
algorithms: 1) t-SNE represents the similarity of papers in 2D space and 2)
K-means clusters papers discretely, corresponding to the colors.

<h1>Advanced diagnostics</h1>

Paired with historical knowledge, we want to use new experimental technology to try and overcome these engieering challenges. 

For example, we have recently developed a real-time potassium number density diagnostic
